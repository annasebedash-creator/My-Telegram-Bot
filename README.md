# My Telegram Bot Assistant

This repository contains the configuration for my experimental Telegram bot assistant.

## Overview

This project was created as part of my personal exploration into workflow automation, especially focusing on the [n8n](https://n8n.io) automation platform and low-code solutions. My goal was to learn how automation works, experiment with different integrations, and see how a Telegram bot could simplify daily routines.

## Features

- Automates responses and messaging through Telegram
- Designed as a low-code solution managed via n8n
- Can help streamline your everyday life and improve productivity
- Flexible: can be used as a personal planner, assistant, or customized for company-specific needs

### Integrations & Use Cases

- Accesses your calendar (for reminders or event management)
- Creates tasks in Notion
- Summarizes content from your Notion workspace
- Connects to your main databases and tools used for work or personal life
- Can serve as a personal productivity tool or a customizable team assistant

## Repository Contents

- `My Bot Assistant.json`:

## Getting Started

1. Download the `My Bot Assistant.json` file.
2. Import it into your n8n instance (or other compatible automation tool).
